Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to get price elasticity 

### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the price elasticity of various products to understand their responsiveness to price changes. The analysis involves data cleaning, creating new columns for revenue and profit, and segmenting different business models to account for factors like weekends, holidays, and school breaks. The aim is to provide insights into optimal pricing strategies and inventory management.

#### **Data Cleaning**

- Performed thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Created new columns for **Revenue** and **Profit** to analyze the financial performance of different products.

### **Business Segmentation**

- Segregated the "Business as Usual" model to exclude weekends, holidays, and school breaks.
- Analyzed product performance under different scenarios to understand the impact of these factors on demand and pricing.

### **Price Elasticity Analysis**

- Used an **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model** to calculate the **price elasticity** for each product related to its unique `sell_id`, measuring demand sensitivity to price changes.
- Determined the **R-squared** relationship between **price** and **quantity** to assess the strength and direction of the correlation.

### **Key Findings**

- Identified the optimal pricing points for maximum profitability using the OLS regression model.
- Recommended inventory levels based on demand forecasts derived from elasticity calculations.
- As Price went up demand often went down 

### **Conclusion**

The project provides valuable insights into how different pricing strategies affect product demand and profitability. The use of the OLS model helps to determine the most effective pricing strategy to maximize revenue while considering the elasticity of demand.
